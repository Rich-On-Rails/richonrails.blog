ðŸš‚ ðŸ“· So what are these boards?

We will place these boards on locomotive, rolling stock or anything else on the railway that is literally not to be moved, on main railways they would be magnetic and you could put them onto the end of the locomotive.

The rules state that the board should not be removed by anyone but the person who put it there, but why?

They could be in the pit or working on the underside of the locomotive or the locomotive or rolling stock just shouldnâ€™t be moved for other reasons.

If you see this board on a locomotive or carriage that is what it means.
